# terraform-azurerm-avm-template

This is a template repo for Terraform Azure Verified Modules.

Things to do:

1. Set up a GitHub repo environment called `test`.
1. Configure environment protection rule to ensure that approval is required before deploying to this environment.
1. Create a user-assigned managed identity in your test subscription.
1. Create a role assignment for the managed identity on your test subscription, use the minimum required role.
1. Configure federated identity credentials on the user assigned managed identity. Use the GitHub environment.
1. Search and update TODOs within the code and remove the TODO comments once complete.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As the overall AVM framework is not GA (generally available) yet - the CI framework and test automation is not fully functional and implemented across all supported languages yet - breaking changes are expected, and additional customer feedback is yet to be gathered and incorporated. Hence, modules **MUST NOT** be published at version `1.0.0` or higher at this time.
>
> All module **MUST** be published as a pre-release version (e.g., `0.1.0`, `0.1.1`, `0.2.0`, etc.) until the AVM framework becomes GA.
>
> However, it is important to note that this **DOES NOT** mean that the modules cannot be consumed and utilized. They **CAN** be leveraged in all types of environments (dev, test, prod etc.). Consumers can treat them just like any other IaC module and raise issues or feature requests against them as they learn from the usage of the module. Consumers should also read the release notes for each version, if considering updating to a more recent version of a module to see if there are any considerations or breaking changes etc.

## Required Inputs

The following input variables are required:

### <a name="input_location"></a> [location](#input\_location)

Description:   "Required. The Azure region for deployment of the this resource."

Type: `string`

### <a name="input_name"></a> [name](#input\_name)

Description:   "Required. The name of the this resource."

Type: `string`

## Optional Inputs

The following input variables are optional (have default values):

### <a name="input_enable_telemetry"></a> [enable\_telemetry](#input\_enable\_telemetry)

Description: This variable controls whether or not telemetry is enabled for the module.  
For more information see <https://aka.ms/avm/telemetryinfo>.  
If it is set to false, then no telemetry will be collected.

Type: `bool`

Default: `true`

### <a name="input_lock"></a> [lock](#input\_lock)

Description:   Controls the Resource Lock configuration for this resource. The following properties can be specified:

  - `kind` - (Required) The type of lock. Possible values are `\"CanNotDelete\"`, `\"ReadOnly\"` and `\"None\"`.
  - `name` - (Optional) The name of the lock. If not specified, a name will be generated based on the `kind` value. Changing this forces the creation of a new resource.  

  Example Input:

  ```hcl
  lock = {
      kind = "CanNotDelete"|"ReadOnly"|"None"
      name = "lock-<name>"
    }
```

Type:

```hcl
object({
    kind = optional(string, "None")
    name = optional(string, null)
  })
```

Default: `{}`

### <a name="input_role_assignments"></a> [role\_assignments](#input\_role\_assignments)

Description: Optional. A map of role assignments to create on this resource. The map key is deliberately arbitrary to avoid issues where map keys maybe unknown at plan time.

- `role_definition_id_or_name` - (Required) The ID or name of the role definition to assign to the principal.
- `principal_id` - (Required) The ID of the principal to assign the role to.
- `description` - (Optional) The description of the role assignment.
- `skip_service_principal_aad_check` - (Optional) If set to true, skips the Azure Active Directory check for the service principal in the tenant. Defaults to false.
- `condition` - (Optional) The condition which will be used to scope the role assignment.
- `condition_version` - (Optional) The version of the condition syntax. Valid values are '2.0'.
- `delegated_managed_identity_resource_id` - (Optional) The delegated Azure Resource Id which contains a Managed Identity. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. NOTE:  
this field is only used in cross tenant scenario.

> Note: only set `skip_service_principal_aad_check` to true if you are assigning a role to a service principal.

Example Input:
```hcl
role_assignments = {
  "role_assignment1" = {
    role_definition_id_or_name = "Reader"
    principal_id = "4179302c-702e-4de7-a061-beacd0a1be09"
    
  },
"role_assignment2" = {

  principal_id = "4179302c-702e-4de7-a061-beacd0a1be09"
  skip_service_principal_aad_check = false
  condition_version = "2.0"
  condition = <<-EOT
